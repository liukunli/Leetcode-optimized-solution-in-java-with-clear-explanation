Optimized solution, O(n) time, O(n) space:

1. Use HashMap to store the elements in the array
2. Then loop through the array again. Check in the HashMap

Notes:

1. Cannot use HashSet since we need to get the index

Other solution 1, O(n logn) time, O(1) space:

Sort the array. Then use double pointer search.
